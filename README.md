# GuessThePlayerGame

Console game written in python, based on data set containing basic statistics of Premier League players from 19/20 season. Your goal is to guess the player based on a few given stats and information from this period. User can choose level of difficulty (1-4). 5 tips are given, after each user can take a challange to guess, but after that he won't be able to see another tips. I am going to work more on this project in the future, so it's only a basic version at the moment. Guessing a player may be really hard, especially those with the 3/4 difficulty level :)
